# AlphaGenome Heterotypic Enhancer Cocktail Experiment

We assemble synthetic enhancer "lattices" that mix HS2, GATA1, and HNF4A
modules across the 1 MiB AlphaGenome canvas. By permuting module order,
spacing, orientation, and CTCF separators we test whether AlphaGenome encodes
motif-specific cooperation versus additive independence.

## Constructs

Construct FASTA files are generated by `build_cocktail_constructs.py`. Each
configuration specifies:

- Module order (e.g., HS2 → GATA1 → HNF4A)
- Repeat count of the motif triad
- Spacer length between modules and between repeats
- Module orientation (`+` forward, `-` reverse complement)
- Optional CTCF brackets or separators

All constructs remain 1,048,576 bp long with the HBG1 promoter centered at
500 kb. Module placements and metadata are recorded in
`construct_manifest.json` for downstream analysis.

## Pipeline

1. **Build constructs**
   ```bash
   python build_cocktail_constructs.py
   ```
2. **Run AlphaGenome DNase predictions**
   ```bash
   conda run -n alphagenome-env python run_cocktail_predictions.py
   ```
3. **Analyze & plot**
   ```bash
   conda run -n alphagenome-env python analyze_cocktail_results.py
   ```

Outputs are saved under `alphagenome_outputs/`, `results/`, and run logs under
`logs/`.

## TL;DR

The latest findings are distilled in `summary.md`. Highlights from the inaugural
batch:

- HNF4A modules drive the strongest DNase response across all permutations.
- Module orientation/order tweaks only modestly perturb accessibility.
- Inter-repeat CTCF separators dampen peak intensity while nudging promoter
   signal higher.
